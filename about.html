    <h2>President’s Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Welcome to MECG’s official website! Thank you for your interest in MECG and exploring what we have to offer. Founded by a group of like-minded engineers, we are committed to delivering high-impact solutions while providing consulting opportunities for students.</p>

    <p>When I joined MECG as a part of the first class of new members, I was looking for a space where I could further my knowledge of consulting as an engineer and build strong connections with others. As President, I strive to ensure that MECG offers just that: an organization where all students, regardless of their background or experience, feel welcomed and supported.</p>

    <p>At MECG, the only quality that we look for in students is the eagerness to learn more about the consulting world. I believe that anyone who wishes to broaden their understanding in consulting should feel empowered to do so. By providing a full education curriculum, wide range of project experiences, and early career opportunities, MECG is here to help you grow.</p>

    <p>I encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and seek the professional growth and community that MECG has to offer. Please don’t hesitate to contact us at mecg-board@umich.edu or follow @mecgmichigan on Instagram for more updates.</p>

    <p>Best,<br>Jules Hwang<br>President of MECG, 2025</p>
